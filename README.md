When we discuss about Artificial Intelligence or Robotics, Computer Vision emerges as a fundamental component for the development of an increasingly safe, autonomous and interactive society. In parallel with this, we have observed a notable evolution in high-resolution cameras and drones, offering an infinite range of application possibilities in different sectors, such as agriculture, property security and surveillance. In response to this scientific evolution, the Drone Project unites these two growing areas: the use of compact programmable drones and Computer Vision. The Drone to be used in the project will be the DJI Tello drone and all tools will be narrated throughout the project
